Calculate more fit indices
}
\description{
Calculate more fit indices that are not already provided in lavaan. 
}
\usage{
moreFitIndices(object, nPrior = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{The lavaan model object provided after running the \code{cfa} or the \code{sem} functions.}
  \item{nPrior}{The sample size on which prior is based. This argument is used to compute BIC*.}

\details{
Normed Fit Index (nfi; West, Taylor, & Wu, 2012) is one of the relative fit indices which can be computed by

\deqn{ nfi =\frac{\chi^{2}_{0} - \chi^{2}_{k}}{\chi^{2}_{0}},}

where \eqn{\chi^{2}_{k}} is the chi-square test statistic value of the target model, \eqn{\chi^{2}_{0}} is the chi-square test statistic value of the null model.  

Incremental Fit Index (ifi; West, Taylor, & Wu, 2012) is one of the relative fit indices which can be computed by

\deqn{ ifi =\frac{\chi^{2}_{0} - \chi^{2}_{k}}{\chi^{2}_{0} - df_{k}},}

where \eqn{df_{k}} is the degree of freedom when fitting the target model  

Gamma Hat (gfi*; West, Taylor, & Wu, 2012) is one of the relative fit indices which can be computed by

\deqn{ gfi* =\frac{p}{p + 2 \times \frac{\chi^{2}_{k} - df_{k}}{N - 1}},}

where \eqn{N} is the sample size, \eqn{p} is the number of variables in the model. 

Adjusted Gamma Hat (agfi*; West, Taylor, & Wu, 2012) is one of the relative fit indices which can be computed by

\deqn{ agfi* = \left(1 - \frac{p \times (p + 1)}{2 \times df_{k}} \right) \times \left( 1 - gfi* \right) ,}

Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc; Burnham & Anderson, 2003) is the corrected version of aic for small sample size:

\deqn{ aicc = f + \frac{2k(k + 1)}{N - k - 1},}

where \eqn{f} is the minimized discrepancy function, which is the product of the log likelihood and -2, and \eqn{k} is the number of parameters in the target model.

Expected Value of Cross-Validation Index (ECVI; West, Taylor, & Wu, 2012) is the average discrepancy in the fitted covariance matrices between two samples of equal sample size across all possible combinations of two samples from the same population:

\deqn{ ecvi = f + \frac{2 \times k}{N},}

Stochastic information criterion (sic; Preacher, 2006) is similar to aic or bic. This index will account for model complexity in the model's function form, in addition to the number of free parameters. sic can be computed by

\deqn{ sic = \frac{1}{2}\left(f - \log{\det{I(\hat{\theta})}}\right),}

where \eqn{I(\hat{\theta})} is the information matrix of the parameters.

Corrected Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC*; Kuha, 2004) is similar to bic but explicitly specifying the sample size on which the prior is based (\eqn{N_{prior}}).

\deqn{ bicc = f + k\log{(1 + N/N_{prior})},}

Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (hqc; Hannan & Quinn, 1979) is used for model selection similar to aic or bic.

\deqn{ hqc = f + 2k\log{(\log{N})},}
